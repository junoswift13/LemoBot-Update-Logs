## Reporting a Vulnerability
# üîê Security Vulnerability Reporting

We take security seriously and strive to build safe and reliable software for everyone. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Self-Promo Auto-Moderation Bot, we strongly encourage responsible disclosure.

## üõ°Ô∏è How to Report a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.**  
   Avoid posting details publicly (e.g., GitHub issues, Discord, forums, social media).

2. **Privately contact us via email:**  
    **alaqlanders@gmail.com**

3. Include as much information as possible in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Potential impact.
   - Suggested fix (optional but appreciated).
   - Any relevant logs, code snippets, or screenshots.

4. We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide regular status updates.

##  In-Scope Vulnerabilities

We are particularly interested in:
- Unauthorized privilege escalation
- Bypass of keyword detection
- Circumventing mute or offense systems
- Data leakage (e.g., exposure of keywords.json, config.json, or internal bot memory)
- Token leaks or credential exposures
- Abuse of admin slash commands by non-authorized users

##  Our Commitment

- All reports will be investigated and validated.
- Valid vulnerabilities will be addressed with appropriate patches.
- Credit may be given to responsible reporters (optional).
